# P02-A3 — Per-repository scoping of the fork registry

**Fault:** A3 — global flat fork registry clobbers across repositories
([P02 register](../../../projects/P02-agent-fork-fault-remediation.md)).

**Status:** gate 1 (adversarial verification) in progress. Gates 3–6 open.

**Worktree:** `worktree-p02-a3-registry-repo-scope`, based on `origin/main`
at `aefcda0`.

## Verification verdict and evidence

**Claim (as registered):** one machine-wide `forks.json` whose
`RegistryEntry` (`models.py:53-75`) carries no repository field. `add_entry`
(`registry.py:111`) deletes a same-named entry belonging to another
repository; `find_owned` (`registry.py:127-136`) matches a bare name or
branch across every repository, so cleanup can resolve another
repository's worktree; the auto-name collision check (`cli.py:490-516`)
never consults the registry.

**Empirical repro (Claude, 2026-08-17).** Throwaway repositories under one
`XDG_STATE_HOME`, `agent-fork fork … --no-agent`, CLI 1.0.0. Four probes,
all reproduced:

| # | Probe | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `fork shared` in repoA, then in repoB | registry holds one entry; repoA's row is gone; no warning on either run |
| 2 | `fork alpha` in repoC only, then `cleanup alpha --dry-run --allow-unpushed` from repoD | `would remove worktree …/repoC-fork-alpha; branch: delete fork/alpha` — repoD has no such fork |
| 3 | `fork` with **no name argument** in two repos both on `main` | both derive name `main-0817` and branch `fork/main-0817`; second run clobbers the first's row silently |
| 4 | after probe 3, `cleanup main-0817 --dry-run --allow-unpushed` from repoE | `would remove worktree …/repoF-fork-main-0817; branch: delete fork/main-0817` |

**Two corrections to the register's framing, both raising severity:**

1. **The collision is on the default path, not an opt-in one.** The register
   implies a user-chosen duplicate name. Probe 3 shows `agent-fork fork`
   with no `NAME` derives `<branch>-<MMDD>`, so any two repositories on
   `main` forked on the same day collide by construction. No user error is
   required.
2. **The consequence is destructive, not merely lost bookkeeping.** Probe 4
   shows the clobbered repository's worktree survives on disk while its
   registry row does not; a later `cleanup` issued from that repository
   resolves and plans to delete *another* repository's worktree **and
   branch**. This is the fault's true impact and the reason its type is
   recorded as a data-safety fix.

**Codex adversarial pass:** in progress; verdict and corrections recorded
here on completion.

## Design

Pending gate 1 completion.

## Implementation plan (TDD; subagent-driven)

Pending gate 3 completion.
